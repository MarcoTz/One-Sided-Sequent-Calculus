# Web App

To compile the web demo, run the `buld_web.sh` script in the root directory of this repo.
This will compile the Haskell code into javascript and copy the compiled script into the web-app folder.
With this, the demo can be run locally by opening `index.html` in a browser.

For more information on the GHC Javascript backend, see [the GHC documentation](https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/javascript.html)
For a guid on how to install the Javascript backend with ghcup, see [the ghcup guide](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/guide/), under the GHC JS cross bindists section.
